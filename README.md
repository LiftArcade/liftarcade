# ðŸ‘‹ A built-in-public repo for liftarcade's fitness app.

### Project Overview
This serves as the high level view of the project structure.

The goal of this project is two fold:
 - To build in public with a large portion being an open source project for many to learn from, garner criticism, and allow contributions in what I hope will become a medium-to-large sized project.
 - To start a partially open source company that is profitable and provides reliable, well documented fitness advice for those interested.

#### Github structure and planned licensing
There will be a large portion of the company planned in the open source space, however, a few mission critical pieces will be behind a closed space to maintain some degree of competitive advantage (Again noting that we do intend to be slightly profit driven).
- SvelteKit Front End Website (Open source MIT license)
- SvelteKit Front End Web App (Open source MIT license)
- Mobile platform app ( To be decided, likely React Native - Unclear on how to license this at this time.)
- Private NPM package for some APIs. (Copyright retained - this will be in a separate hosted Github package, you will likely see this as preferenced npm packages).
